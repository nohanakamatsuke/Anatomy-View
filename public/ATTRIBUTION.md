Adaptations: axes and units converted from millimeters/Z-up to meters/Y-up; translated to rest at the stage; geometry simplified using meshoptimizer with 0.2% relative error limit per structure; normals quantized to signed 16-bit; packed into binary chunks; curated display system groupings and colors. The source contains 2,234 individual OBJ meshes; all remain represented. The combined hierarchy contains 3,432 named FMA concepts, which may reference multiple meshes. Original source identity is preserved in the manifest.

Source OBJ comments mention an older CC BY-SA 2.1 Japan license. The official current database license linked above supersedes that legacy text and explicitly permits redistribution and adaptation under CC BY 4.0.

BodyParts3D represents an adult male reference anatomy based on TARO MRI and anatomical illustration refinements. It is not a complete model of every possible human anatomical structure or variation. This interface is educational and is not a clinical tool.

Adaptations: translated native meter/Y-up coordinates onto the stage, coincident vertices welded and source normals averaged, geometry simplified with a 0.2% per-structure relative error bound, and normals quantized. Colors and display systems are curated for this interface. All 888 source meshes are represented, with 1,073 source nodes available as selectable individual or compound concepts.

This is a reference assembly with whole-body surface and selected organs, including female reproductive anatomy. Its skeleton and muscle coverage is partial. It is not a complete model of every human structure or a single-person scan. Eight placenta/umbilical structures are classified under Pregnancy reference and hidden by default.

## ANATOMIA adaptation

This application repackages all 2,234 meshes of the optimized Human Atlas geometry (https://github.com/ashemag/human-atlas) into ten independently downloaded layers. BodyParts3D source identifiers, names, and geometry are retained. All source meshes are retained, covering 15 original source system classifications. They are assigned to 10 independently selectable display layers. The organs layer combines visceral organ systems with brain structures; other nervous structures form a separate layer. Japanese navigation labels and selected general descriptions have been added; unreviewed individual structure names remain in English. Rendering colors are illustrative and are not tissue measurements. The mesh classification and layer names are simplified for exploration and are not exhaustive anatomical system definitions.

This adaptation is not endorsed by the data authors. The app is an exploratory educational viewer, not a substitute for a reviewed anatomy textbook or clinical material.

Curation note: liver hepatovenous segments have been assigned to the organ display layer and colored as liver tissue while preserving original source IDs and classification metadata. Brain components share a brain display color. Lung concepts in this source consist primarily of bronchial and vascular branches; lung parenchymal outer surfaces and alveoli are not represented.
